##hdf_to_tif - HDT to GeoTiff conversion tool

This script is mostly a wrapper for HEG utils (works on v2.14):
    https://newsroom.gsfc.nasa.gov/sdptoolkit/HEG/HEGHome.html
The tools provided are confusing and hard to automatize, which justifies this.

To start using the tool, install HEG and set in the .py file the vars:
    .CVT_CMD
    .STAT_CMD
    .WARP_CMD
    .ENV
